# Minchir _/ËˆmÉªÅ‹kÉ™r/_

Minchir is a login and consent app for [ORY Hydra](https://github.com/ory/hydra) backed by your existing [LDAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol) infrastructure. Its UI supports easy customization via templates and internationalization for different languages.

SCREENCAP

## Current state / versioning

Any Minchir version starting with `0.` should be considered experimental, instable and/or incomplete. There can and will be breaking changes between experimental releases possibly without any warnings attached as there currently is no documentation. This will all change with the release of version `1.0.0` which will mark the first stable release. From then on out users can expect to not have any breaking changes for minor or patch releases and migration guides for major releases when needed.

Until that elusive version `1.0.0` lands use Minchir at your own risk. ðŸ˜Ž
